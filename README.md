School assignment in grade 11 to use python to translate a board game into code.
This is the product.
Don't try moving the black bishops backward as there is a chance you will break the code.
I could fix it by removing the 'piece_check' function for bishops, or just taking the 'piece_check' function out of the 'king_check' function.
Either way, the problem is with the 'piece_check' function.
I hadn't learned classes yet when I made this, and I only kind of understand them now.
